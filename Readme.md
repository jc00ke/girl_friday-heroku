# girl\_friday on Heroku

You don't really have to do much. In fact, you don't have to anything special at all!

This is a great way to get background workers on Heroku for free.

## Note:
Mike even states you [shouldn't use a EM/non-threaded server like thin](https://github.com/mperham/girl_friday/wiki/FAQ), but you can. Not ideal, but hey, it's free.
